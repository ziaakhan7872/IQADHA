With just a pen and a paper in my hand I calculated my missed prayers. When the final figure reached to an astronomical point. I knew this was serious business. Allah (swt) loves pure intentions and I wanted to really make my Umrah count. _n_n I decided to make an app so I could track and monitor all my prayers. More importantly I wanted to keep it in the cloud so I knew, if anything happened to me or the server - it will always be around. _n_n Thus iQadha was born. I hope it becomes a source of success in the Hereafter and be a source of Khair for me and the Ummah inshaa-Allah.",

I, too, have not prayed.\" So we turned towards Buthan, and the Prophet (saw) performed ablution and we too performed ablution and offered the `Asr prayer after the sun had set, and then he offered the Maghrib prayer.[Bukhari] _n_n Alhamdulilah. There are plenty of resources available online that answer many questions regarding Qadha salah. The purpose of our app is to aid you. We highly recommend you speak to your local scholar because all four Imams are on view that Qadha is obligatory. _n_n Futhermore, Qatada reported it on the authority of Anas bin Malik (ra) that the Messenger of Allah (saw) said: When any one of you omits the prayer due to sleep or he forgets it, he should observe it when he remembers it, for Allah has said: \"Observe prayer for remembrance of Me.\" [Muslim]",

            "answer" : "There are some short cut methods on the Internet which suggest skipping Sunnah in prayers and thus shortening it but such a prayer would be devoid of blessings and lessen the reward. _n_n However, you could try these tips: _n_n - Always try to be in wudhu. _n_n - Perform one qadha salah before or after every fardh salah. _n_n -Pray a full set of 6 after Jummah. _n_n - Pray extra qadha during Ramadhan and on the weekends. _n_n - Pray in privacy – this method works exceptionally well, especially for night Tahajud prayers. “If you want to know how close you are to Allah, think about how you spend your time alone”. _n_n - Start small remain keep consistent. Stones make mountains. Once you are strict in your routine and you feel you can add more than add more. _n_n - Share this app and encourage friends and family.",
